# 🧪 Unit Tests for Core Utility Functions

This directory contains unit tests for core utility functions developed using Jest.


## 🚀 Test Cases
- ✅ Capitalizes the first letter of a word
- ✅ Reverses the order of characters in a string
- ✅ Calculator object with add, subtract, divide, multiply methods
- ✅ Caesar Cipher with shifting logic
- ✅ Returns object with average, min, max, and length of an array

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (for local testing, optional)
- Jest (for unit testing)

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

### 📌 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Concepts
- Tests define expected behavior, which can guide implementation or refactoring.
- **Iterative** and **recursive** generation of the first N Fibonacci numbers
- Understanding of recursion and memoization potential

### 📌 Unit Testing
- Each function is tested independently to verify it behaves as expected given specific inputs.

### 📌  Modular Programming
- Each utility is separated into its own function/module, promoting **code reusability** and **single responsibility**.

### 📌 Use of ES6 Modules
- Functions are imported using `import/export` syntax, demonstrating **modern JavaScript module management**.
